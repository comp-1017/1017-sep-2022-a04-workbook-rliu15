                the cell tag for this line will be <th>

                Optionally one can have their header titles on their rows
                here the devoloper uses the list collum as the titles for the data
                if you are designing your table in this fashion a the thread area is not needed and the first cell on your table body row will be a <th> cell

                tbody contains the data for the table
                each represents a row of table data
                think of a grid style system
                the text will not have any styling by defualt


                See above for using <th> cell if you wish your headings
                    to appear on the row instad of the collum top

                    by defualt you are expected to have one <th> cell for each <th> cell

                        <td> cells are grouped under a <tr> set of tags
